# Quality evidence

This directory keeps the small, reviewable evidence used by the routine
quality gate.

`recommended.baseline` contains the 22 findings accepted after reviewing the
analyzer's own sources with `--recommended`. Duplicate fingerprints are
intentional: the baseline records occurrences, not only unique shapes. The
gate fails when a new non-baselined finding appears; removing an old finding
does not fail the gate.

`known_analysis_issues.tsv` is the registry of confirmed analyzer mistakes.
An open false-positive or false-negative entry contributes to the release
metrics. A zero count means that no confirmed case is currently open; it is
not a claim that the analyzer has zero unknown mistakes.

`release_metrics.csv` records, per release:

- Open confirmed false positives.
- Open confirmed false negatives.
- Supported verification-construct families. This is currently the number of
  explicit `Obligation_Kind` families, each of which can still be classified
  as `Unproved` or `Unsupported`; it is not a whole-program proof claim.
- Reviewed findings in the recommended self-analysis baseline.
- Cases in the precision corpus (see "Precision corpus" below).

Run the evidence checks with:

```sh
sh tests/run_recommended_gate.sh
sh tests/run_quality_metrics.sh
sh tests/run_automotive_evidence.sh
sh tests/run_precision_corpus.sh
```

`automotive_rule_evidence.tsv` maps every check enabled by `--automotive` to a
positive and clean invocation. `run_automotive_evidence.sh` fails if the
implemented preset, the Automotive Ada Compliance Matrix, and this manifest
do not contain the same rule set, or if any mapped fixture stops producing
the expected result.

## Precision corpus

`precision_corpus.tsv` is a growing, machine-checked corpus of boundary and
negative cases: fixtures constructed to sit exactly at a check's decision
boundary, with the expected outcome (`clean` or `finding`) recorded
alongside. `run_precision_corpus.sh` runs every row in isolation
(`-checks="-*,<rule>"`) and fails the gate if any fixture's actual outcome
disagrees with the recorded expectation — the corpus size itself is tracked
as `precision_corpus_cases` in `release_metrics.csv`, the same way the other
evidence categories in this directory are tracked, so it can only grow, never
silently shrink, across releases.

Current coverage (17 cases):

- 12 threshold boundary cases: the six checks with a configurable numeric
  threshold — `Cyclomatic_Complexity`, `Deep_Nesting`, `Too_Many_Parameters`,
  `Long_Line`, `Generic_Instantiation_Limit`, `Dependency_Limit` — each with
  an "exactly at the default threshold" fixture that must stay clean and a
  "threshold plus one" fixture that must fire. Every boundary value in the
  corpus was confirmed against the built analyzer's own diagnostic message
  (e.g. "cyclomatic complexity 11 exceeds threshold 10"), not derived from
  reading the check's source and assuming it is correct.
- 5 regression-negative cases, folded in from the "Precision regression
  index" below: `Library_Level_Initialization`, `No_Compiler_Extensions`,
  `Uninitialized_Read`, `Wrong_Parameter_Mode`, and `Dead_Store`, each on the
  existing fixture the index already pointed at. Only rows that map cleanly
  to one rule and one checked-in fixture were folded in this way; the
  remaining index rows reference the analyzer's own source or a bounded
  `--verify` proof-obligation outcome rather than a `Rule_Kind` finding on a
  `tests/*.adb` fixture, and stay prose-only rather than force an uncertain
  mapping into a gate (see the index below for which).

This is a starting corpus, not a complete one. Still open, in roughly
increasing order of effort:

- Boundary/negative cases for checks without a numeric threshold (e.g.
  suspicious-but-legitimate constructs that resemble a violation without
  being one).
- A project-scale corpus of real (non-synthetic) Ada code with a manually
  reviewed sample, to estimate precision beyond hand-constructed fixtures.
- Cross-version stability: re-running the same corpus across analyzer
  releases and tracking whether previously stable results change.
- Independent-oracle comparison against another tool (e.g. GNATcheck) on the
  subset of checks with real overlap.

## Precision regression index

Each precision correction has an executable regression:

| Corrected mechanism | Regression evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Static attributes are not elaboration calls | `automotive_state_clean.ads`, run by `run_automotive.sh`; also `Library_Level_Initialization` in `precision_corpus.tsv` |
| Generated configuration pragmas are not authored extensions | `run_automotive.sh` generated-config check; also `No_Compiler_Extensions` in `precision_corpus.tsv` |
| A pure `out` actual initializes its variable | `uninitialized_read_clean.adb`, run by `run_bug_findings.sh`; also `Uninitialized_Read` in `precision_corpus.tsv` |
| A parameterless prefixed mutator writes its prefix | `parameter_mode_clean.adb`, run by `run_bug_findings.sh`; also `Wrong_Parameter_Mode` and `Dead_Store` in `precision_corpus.tsv` |
| Failure-path `out` initialization is not an overwritten assignment | Numeric-literal self-check in `run_recommended.sh` (not folded into `precision_corpus.tsv`: the fixture is the analyzer's own source, not a `tests/*.adb` file) |
| State captured by a nested verifier pass is not a dead store | Flow-interpreter self-check in `run_recommended.sh` (not folded: same reason) |
| Required cleanup status outputs are consumed | VC-prover self-check in `run_recommended.sh` (not folded: same reason) |
| Direct outer `out`-to-`out` forwarding is a write, not a read | `verification_diff_modular_call.adb`, run by `run_verification.sh` and `run_gnatprove_differential.sh` (not folded: this is a bounded `--verify` proof-obligation outcome, not a `Rule_Kind` finding) |

When another precision bug is fixed, add or extend a fixture and add its row
here in the same change.

## Differential corpus

The GNATprove differential gate contains 16 clean and 5 deliberately broken
units. Five clean units are added for the current development release:

- Bounded arithmetic and assignment chaining.
- Conditional range refinement.
- Modular contract transfer.
- Indexed array access.
- Relational loop invariants.

The modular-call case now exercises direct forwarding from an outer `out`
parameter to a nested `out` parameter. It is the regression for closed issue
`FP-001` and must remain free of a definite initialization error.

Run it with `sh tests/run_gnatprove_differential.sh`. The script rejects
`Definite_Error` or `Unsupported` AdaLang results on the clean corpus and
requires GNATprove to prove all 16 clean units. It also requires GNATprove to
find failures in every unit of the broken corpus.
