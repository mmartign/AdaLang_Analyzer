# adalang_analyzer

`adalang_analyzer` is an independent command-line static analysis tool for Ada
source code maintained by [Spazio IT](https://spazioit.com/). It parses Ada and
reports rule violations with source locations, explanations, and remediation
guidance.

## Relationship to Libadalang and AdaCore

- **Engine:** This tool is built on top of
  [Libadalang](https://github.com/AdaCore/libadalang), the open-source semantic
  engine developed by AdaCore.
- **Lineage:** The codebase is a derivative of AdaCore's open-source
  `libadalang-tools` repository.
- **Disclaimer:** This is an independent project maintained solely by Spazio
  IT. It is not endorsed, sponsored, or officially supported by AdaCore.
  “Libadalang” and “AdaCore” are trademarks of AdaCore.

## Checks

The analyzer currently detects:

- discouraged constructs: `No_Goto`, `No_Abort`, `No_Raise`, `No_Exit`,
  `No_Label`, `No_Pragma`, and `No_Access_To_Subp_Def`;
- constant conditions and unreachable code or branches;
- statically detectable division by zero and reversed ranges;
- self-assignments, repeated operands, and duplicate conditions;
- contradictory conditions and identical conditional branches;
- repeated assignments, ineffective operations, and operations forced to a
  constant result;
- null statements, empty loops, and empty exception handlers.

Run `adalang_analyzer -list-checks` to see the authoritative list together
with a description and guidance for every check.

## Requirements

- [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/) and a GNAT Ada toolchain;
- macOS with the Apple Command Line Tools for the current development
  configuration;
- the dependencies declared in `alire.toml`, which Alire resolves during the
  build.

## Build

From the repository root:

```sh
alr build
```

The executable is produced under `bin/`.

Run the bug-finding regression suite after building:

```sh
sh tests/run_bug_findings.sh
```

## Usage

Enable every check for one or more Ada source files:

```sh
./bin/adalang_analyzer -checks='*' src/main.adb
```

Select individual checks or disable checks from a broader selection:

```sh
./bin/adalang_analyzer \
  -checks='*, -No_Pragma, -Null_Statement' src/*.adb
```

Checks can also be toggled with `+R<check>` and `-R<check>` switches:

```sh
./bin/adalang_analyzer \
  +RNo_Goto +RDivision_By_Zero src/main.adb
```

Useful options include:

```text
-h, --help       Show command help
-version         Show the version
-list-checks     List all available checks
-checks=<list>   Enable or disable a comma-separated set of checks
-v, -verbose     Print files as they are parsed
-q, -quiet       Suppress the final summary
--               Treat all remaining arguments as file names
```

The command exits unsuccessfully when it finds a violation or cannot process
the requested input, which makes it suitable for scripts and CI checks.
